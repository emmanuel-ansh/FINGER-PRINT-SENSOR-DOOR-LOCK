# FINGER-PRINT-SENSOR-DOOR-LOCK
 A biometric door lock prototype for safer homes! IOT(Internet Of Things)

This project presents a door lock system using adafruit fingerprint sensor and a servo motor with the help of which lock is made.
Fingerprint locks are very strong locks as it can't be opened without the human fingerprint which is unique for all.

THINGS REQUIRED 

1.Arduino Uno

2.Adafruit Fingrprint Sensor

3.Servo Motor

4.Jumper Wires

5.Bread Board

6.Arduino IDE


STEPS

1. MAKE THE CONNECTIONS AS GIVEN IN THE CONNECTION DOCUMENT.

5. PLACE YOUR FINGRPRINT ON THE SENSOR AND YOUR LOCK UNLOCKS...!!!!




*** WORKING ON A MOBILE APP TO RECEIVE LOCKING AND UNLOCKING DETAILS.

*** SAME DETAILS ON A CLOUD PLATFORM.

THANK YOU....!!!!
