# FINGER-PRINT-SENSOR-DOOR-LOCK
 A biometric door lock prototype for safer homes! IOT(Internet Of Things)

This project presents a door lock system using adafruit fingerprint sensor and a servo motor with the help of which lock is made.
Fingerprint locks are very strong locks as it can't be opened without the human fingerprint which is unique for all.
